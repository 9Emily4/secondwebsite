<h1>Don't mind me, I'm just learning to develop my own web pages</h1>

<p>It's actually pretty enjoyable, I didn't know I would pick it all up so quickly! Hopefully I'll be able to work on much more complicated projects soon if I put enough time and effort in :) </p> 

<h2>I'm glad I started learning to program</h2>

<p>It's very rewarding when something works and I'm sure it'll come in very handy in future! I've also got some books to work through which should help guide me with learning what to do, why i need to do it and how it works. </p>

<h3 style= color #7B68EE;>However:</h3>

<p>The main problem I am facing at this point is correctly linking the stylesheet to the html file, this causes problems when it comes to deciding fonts and colour schemes for the page. I just need to learn exactly how to write out a link to a stylesheet in a html file once I've added it to the directory.</p>
