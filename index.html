<h1>Don't mind me, I'm just learning to develop my own web pages</h1>

<p>It's actually pretty enjoyable, I didn't know I would pick it all up so quickly! Hopefully I'll be able to work on much more complicated projects soon if I put enough time and effort in :) </p> 

<h2>I'm glad I started learning to program</h2>

<p>It's very rewarding when something works and I'm sure it'll come in very handy in future</p>
